The following resources can be very helpful in understanding 
kinetic Monte Carlo simulations:

    - `An Introduction to Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations of Surface Reactions <https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642294877>`_ by A. P. J. Jansen.



Acceleration of kinetic Monte Carlo simulations is a topic of its own, which
is discussed in the book by A. P. J. Jansen, and the articles below:

    - E. C. Dybeck et al., `Generalized Temporal Acceleration Scheme for Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations of Surface Catalytic Processes by Scaling the Rates of Fast Reactions <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00859>`_, `J. Chem. Theory Comput.` **(2017)**, 13, 1525.
    
    
The PhD thesis of Mikkel Jørgensen discusses kMC simulations on nanoparticles, and some considerations about how :program:`MonteCoffee` was designed:

    - `Kinetics of Nanoparticle Catalysis from First Principles <https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/508826>`_ by M. Jørgensen.
