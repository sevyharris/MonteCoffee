*************************

There are multiple words which are nice to know in the context of object oriented programming and
kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations:

    - **Instantiate**: the act of creating/constructing a specific object by calling the constructur `__init__()` of a class.
    
    - **Event**: a type of reaction that happens at a specific site.

    - **Turnover frequency**: the number of products formed per site and second.
    
    - **Coordination number**: the number of nearest neighbor sites to an atom. A bulk face centered cubic atom has a coordination number of 12, whereas a (111) atom has 9.

    - **Superbasin**: a set of states connected by fast reversible events.

    - **Coverage**: a fraction of the system-sites that are occupied by either any species or a specific species.
