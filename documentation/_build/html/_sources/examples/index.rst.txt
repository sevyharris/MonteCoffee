We present in this section the CO oxidation over Pt(111) as example to demonstrate how the different parts of the code may work in practice together and how to approach a real system. In the first part the various files needed for the kinetic MonteCarlo simulation are defined. Afterwards we show how the time acceleration works and how to converge the different parameters. In the next step results obtained with the time acceleration are presented and the importance of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions pointed out.

The user interface is essential to :program:`MonteCoffee` as the
code works as a programmable application.
