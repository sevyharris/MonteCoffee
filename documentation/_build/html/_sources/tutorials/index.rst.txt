The tutorials assume that the different elements of :program:`MonteCoffee` are split
into the user_* files. All files described here are provided in the Tutorial folder which is downloaded from :program:`GIT`. Additionally we provide information on how to run parallel simulations using :program:`MonteCoffee` and give some ideas about special site rules for more complex systems.
