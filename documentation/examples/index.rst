Special features 
*****************

We present in this section different special features needed to treat real systems. We show how the time acceleration works and how to converge the different parameters and present results obtained with the time acceleration. 
In addition, the importance of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are pointed out and how turn-over frequencies are calculated.
