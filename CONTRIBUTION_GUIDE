Contributions to MonteCoffee are welcome, given that

Contributions that significantly change how the code is
used in practise, and thus require extensive documentation,
will likely not be considered.

Contributions must follow the following standards
in order to be considered:
---------------------------------------------------
    - Python code should follow PEP8 standards.

    - API documentation is generated using 'pycco'. 
      Thus all modules, methods,
      classes require a docstring.

    - Docstrings must follow Google docstring format.

    - Markdown language may be used for code comments and
      docstrings, provided that it renders beautifully with 'pycco'.
      
    -  The API documentation is built from the root directory
       by "pycco -i -d docs/api -p NeighborKMC/*.py NeighborKMC/base/*.py"

    -  Tutorials, references(encyclopedia), and how-to-guides are built from 
       .py files in ./docs/source/.
       To write a tutorial or how-to, markdown language docstrings are used 
       together with python code that illustrates the example.
