Contributions to MonteCoffee are welcome, given that
they add value to the project, as determined by the
author (M. Jorgensen). To contribute, please send an
email to mikkeljoerg@gmail.com

Contributions that significantly change how the code is
used in practise, and thus require extensive documentation,
will likely not be considered.

Contributions must follow the following standards
in order to be considered:
---------------------------------------------------
    - Python code should follow PEP8 standards.

    - API documentation is generated using 'pycco'. 
      Thus all modules, methods, classes require a docstring.

    - Docstrings must follow the numpy docstring format.
      
    -  The documentation is built according to documentation/HOWTO_BUILD_DOCUMENTATION.txt
