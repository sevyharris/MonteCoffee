TODOLIST:
--------------------

- Make tutorials at the GIT to do both a lattice and nlist based example.

- Make a quick start appear at the GIT front page, together with a "what is kMC. 

- API documentation as part of the code.

- Log the sid_ev list and sid_ev_other and write them to disk instead of writing stype_ev and stype_ev_other.
  This should be done because stype_ev(_other) can be reconstructed from sid_ev.

- Add a script that reconstructs stype_ev.txt from sid_ev.txt

- Add a script that plots the coverages as in test.py

- Make all code follow the documentation conventions.

- Make a run script generator code that lets you y/n to generate user_events.py, user_energy.py and test.py like files.
  This should contain fairly simple events ads/des/diffusion and standard TST(energy,entropy) functions.
