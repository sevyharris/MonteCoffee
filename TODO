TODOLIST:
--------------------

- Remove unnecessary pickling, and move all textfile information to text files.

- Ensure that local updating of events, in frm_update(), depend on the extent of Nearest-Neighbor interactions.

- Make two separate acceleration functions. One based on the rates in superbasins, and one based on
  the rate constants. The settings file should decide which one is used.
