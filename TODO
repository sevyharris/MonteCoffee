TODOLIST:
--------------------

- Split up the doc into a API reference, quick-start, and specific tutorials. Only have the same info once, just
  link if necessary.

- Log the sid_ev list and sid_ev_other and write them to disk instead of writing stype_ev and stype_ev_other.
  This should be done because stype_ev(_other) can be reconstructed from stype_ev.

- Add a script that reconstructs stype_ev.txt from sid_ev.txt
