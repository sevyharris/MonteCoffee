TODOLIST:
--------------------

- Remove unnecessary pickling, and move all textfile information to text files.

- Refactor NeighborKMCBase.frm_init() to call a load_options method, which should load all options.
  only to enhance code readability.

- Split up the doc into a API reference, quick-start, and specific tutorials. Only have the same info once, just
  link if necessary.
